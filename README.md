LibreSL(1): A fork of SL, which still cures your bad habit of mistyping, only better.
=======================================

LibreSL is a drop in replacement for SL which plays an annoying sound to accompany the annoying train.

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at all.
